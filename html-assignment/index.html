        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, Professor Robert Kingsbury! I'm happy to have the opportunity to learn from you.
            My name is Natalia Ribeiro Moreira, I was born on February 25<sup>th</sup>, 2004 in São Paulo, Brazil. My first language is Portuguese, I have been vegetarian for 8 years, and before coming to Canada I studied data science at college. Like you, I also had a cockatiel (it was my first pet), and I currently have a cat.
            </p>
        <p>I have a background as a <abbr title="User Experience Designer">UX Designer</abbr>, I worked in this profession for two years, it's something I like to do. I really liked the company and my work, but 2 weeks ago I took courage and quit my job to start my own agency. I came to Canada in search of a new point of view. I want to travel and live more.
        </p>
